# Dialogporten frontend

## Developer setup

- Install [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and use that to get the correct version of Node in the project.

- Install Docker. We recommend to use OrbStack if you're using Mac or Windows for development, on Linux you can install Docker directly.

- Install pnpm.

- Install fzf.

On macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you can install dependencies by running:

```bash
brew install fnm pnpm fzf
brew install --cask OrbStack
```

On Windows using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) you can install dependencies by running:

```bash
choco install -y fnm pnpm fzf
```

And then installing OrbStack manually
