# Dialogporten frontend

## Developer setup

- Install [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and use that to get the correct version of Node and Yarn in the project.

- Install Docker. We recommend to use OrbStack if you're using Mac or Windows for development, on Linux you can install Docker directly.
