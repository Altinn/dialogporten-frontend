# GraphQL and typegen

<Tldr height="800px" children={drawing} />

The application uses GraphQL for communication.
The build pipeline goes as follow:

1. The `Dialogporten` project publishes the npm package [@digdir/dialogporten-schma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/dialogporten-schema) any time the schema changes

1. We add that npm dependency to our package `dialogporten-types-generated`

    - Here we turn the raw graphql schema into a JavaScript file that exports it as a string and export the from the package.

1. In the `bff` application we define our own GraphQL schema code-first, then we [stitch it](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching) together with the schema we get from `Dialogporten`

1. In `bff-types-generated` we import the stitched schema from `bff`

    - Then we define GraphQL queries and fragment queries that the frontend need in `./packages/bff-types-generated/queries`

    - And then generate TypeScript types from the GraphQL schema as well as functions from the GraphQL queries

    - Only GraphQL types that we have defined a queries/fragment-queris for will actually be generated

1. In the `frontend` we import the `bff-types-generated` package and have ready types and functions that we can use in the frontend

## Development

### When `dialogporten` releases new schema versions

1. Update the package version in `dialogporten-types-generated` based on [the newest verison](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/dialogporten-schema?activeTab=versions)

1. Check for schema changes using [npmdiff.dev](https://npmdiff.dev/) and see if there is any breaking changes

1. Rebuild the project to ensure that there are no new build problems


### Caveats

Currently there are no `dev` tasks that watches for changes setup in `dialogporten-types-generated` and `bff-types-generated` so you may need to rebuild the whole project if you do one of the followign changes:

- Change the schema definitions in the `bff`. The `bff` itself will hot-reload but not the rest.

- Change or write new Graph queries (and fragment queris) in `bff-types-generated`

**TODO**: using `turborepo` setup `dev` tasks and Docker `watch` statements for all of this so that it all rebuilds autoamtically
