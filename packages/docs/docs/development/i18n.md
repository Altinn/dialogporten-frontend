# i18n (internationalization and localization)

This project uses [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) as internationalization framework, and is configured
with [ICU format](https://react.i18next.com/misc/using-with-icu-format), a widely used standard for message format.
[This page](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/messages/) describes the format and covers the most common use cases, including more complex examples.

`react-i18next`is configured in `./src/i18n/index.ts` and initiated as an import in `main.tsx`.

## Adding new translations

Translations are stored in `./src/i18n/resources/` as JSON files. Each file represents a language, and the keys are the same across all files.
To add a new translation, create a new JSON file with the language code as the filename (e.g. `en.json` for English), and add the translations as key-value pairs.

*NB:* All values should be in the ICU format, and every key present in `nb.json` (master) should be present in all other files.

To check all neccessary keys are present in all files, run:
```
pnpm --filter frontend i18n:check
```
This command is also run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
