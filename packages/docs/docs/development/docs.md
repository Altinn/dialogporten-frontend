# Documentation

This site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and contains useful information about the project, including development, deployment and guidelines, intended
for development.

## Drawings

The drawings in the documentation are created with [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
The source files are stored as in the `.excalidraw` format and exported as SVG files. 
> **Note:** We previously used [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com/) for diagrams. However, changes to the licensing and modification terms around *tldraw* made it less practical for our use case. We’ve since standardized on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), which gives us a simpler workflow and keeps the source files easy to store, version, and export.
