title: üèÅ Feature Flags
---

### Quick overview

Feature flags let us enable or disable functionality dynamically **without redeploying the app**.  
They are defined in the frontend, but their values are fetched from the BFF (`/api/features`) before the app starts, and refreshed every 20 minutes. The BFF itself refreshes its configuration every **10 seconds** to stay in sync with Azure App Configuration, ensuring near real-time updates across environments.

### Adding a Feature Flag

1. **Define it in the frontend**  
   Add the flag to `featureFlagDefinitions` in  
   `./frontend/src/featureFlags/FeatureFlags.ts`.
  - Each flag needs a `key`, `type`, and `default` value.
  - Valid types are:
    - `boolean` ‚Üí simple on/off toggle
    - `number` or `string` ‚Üí variant flags (e.g., `"theme.variant" = "dark"`)
    -  Keys use **dot notation** to indicate scope or grouping, e.g.:
     ```
     profile.enableRoutes
     globalMenu.enableProfileLink
     ```
    This makes it easier to organize and reason about related flags.

2. **Register it in the BFF**  
   Add the same key (with a matching default value) to  
   `defaultFeatureFlags` in  
   `./bff/src/features/featureApi.ts`.  
   This ensures the BFF always has a fallback if Azure App Config is unreachable.

3. **Configure it in Azure**  
   Add the key in [Azure App Configuration‚Äôs Feature Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/manage-feature-flags?tabs=azure-portal) for each environment.
  - The key in Azure must match the frontend key exactly.
  - All feature flags in Azure live under the prefix  
    `.appconfig.featureflag/<key>`.
  - Example:
    ```
    .appconfig.featureflag/profile.enableRoutes
    ```

### Nice to know

- Feature flags are **loaded before the app mounts** (if loading fails, defaults are used).
- Flags are exposed app-wide via `FeatureFlagProvider` and accessed through `useFeatureFlag()`.
- The frontend merges **client definitions** and **BFF-provided values** (missing keys always fall back to defaults).
- The BFF uses **Azure App Configuration + Microsoft Feature Management SDK** under the hood.
