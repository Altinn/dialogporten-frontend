# Infrastructure

Infrastructure definitions for the project are located in the `.azure/infrastructure` folder. To add new infrastructure components, follow the existing pattern found within this directory. This involves creating new Bicep files or modifying existing ones to define the necessary infrastructure resources.

For example, to add a new storage account, you would:
- Create or update a Bicep file within the `.azure/infrastructure` folder to include the storage account resource definition.
- Ensure that the Bicep file is referenced correctly in `.azure/infrastructure/infrastructure.bicep` to be included in the deployment process.

Refer to the existing infrastructure definitions as templates for creating new components.
