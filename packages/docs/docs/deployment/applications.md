# Applications

All application Bicep definitions are located in the `.azure/applications` folder. To add a new application, follow the existing pattern found within this directory. This involves creating a new folder for your application under `.azure/applications` and adding the necessary Bicep files (`main.bicep` and environment-specific parameter files, e.g., `test.bicepparam`, `staging.bicepparam`).

For example, to add a new application named `bff-new`, you would:
- Create a new folder: `.azure/applications/bff-new`
- Add a `main.bicep` file within this folder to define the application's infrastructure.
- Use the appropriate `Bicep`-modules within this file. There is one for `Container apps` which you most likely would use.
- Add parameter files for each environment (e.g., `test.bicepparam`, `staging.bicepparam`) to specify environment-specific values.

Refer to the existing applications like `bff` and `frontend` as templates.
