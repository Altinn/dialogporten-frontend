# Emebdable content in Arbeidsflate

Embadable content in Arbeidsflate is a feature that allows users to embed external content, such as markdown and html (only legacy content), directly in Arbeidsflate interface, provided
a url to the content and a dialog token.

Content (`text/plain`) adheres to the current version of [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) (0.31.2).
For examples of how to use the markdown syntax, see [CommonMark examples](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/spec.json).

## Process

1. Embedable content is fetched from the provided URL:
   - (For `mainContentReference`) The content is fetched from the URL specified in the `mainContentReference` field of the dialog on loading the dialog details.
   - (For `contentReference` for transmissions) The content is fetched only when the user expands the transmission in the dialog details.
2. The content is sanitized to ensure security and integrity and is transformed into a React component tree:
   - (For Markdown) Transforms markdown into a sanitized, styled React component tree, allowing safe and customizable rendering.
   - (For legacy HTML) Transforms raw HTML into sanitized, styled React components, ensuring safe display of dynamic HTML.
3. The sanitized content is then displayed in the Arbeidsflate interface.

## Restrictions

For security reasons, the content is sanitized and only certain tags are allowed.
