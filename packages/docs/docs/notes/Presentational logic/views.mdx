# How Dialogs Are Organized In Arbeidsflate

Arbeidsflate displays messages and dialogs in a unified format (`dialogs`) provided by [Dialogporten](https://docs.altinn.studio/dialogporten/),
and organize these dialogs into different views or folders based on their status or other attributes, reflecting their current state or location.
Users can also navigate the inbox using the search bar and various filters to locate specific messages or dialogs.

## Inbox element views in dialogporten-frontend

| Bin         | *(no specific status filter)*                      | Bin      | Status and label can not be overidden                              |


### Filter Categories

Three main filter types are generated:

- **Sender (org):** Based on unique organization IDs present in the dialogs, e.g. SKD.
- **Status:** Derived from `status` and `systemLabel` fields. These are grouped and mapped to human-readable labels. Normalization logic ensures system labels like `Archive` or `Bin` are treated as labels, not statuses.
- **Updated date:** Calculated from dialog `updatedAt` timestamps, grouped into relative time ranges (e.g. *Today*, *This Week*, *Last Year*).

These filters (when applied) are sent to Dialogporten as input parameters, together with (optional) search string (from searchbar) and selected authorized party.
